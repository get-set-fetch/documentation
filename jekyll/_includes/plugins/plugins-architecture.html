Each resource you crawl (html, image, pdf, ...) belongs to a site. </br>
Each site has its own set of plugins and plugin options defining the crawling / scrapping behavior for all resources linked to it. </br></br>

A resource is crawled during a set of predefined phases:
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Phase</th>
            <th scope="col">Sub-phases</th>
            <th scope="col">Functionality</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">SELECT</th>
            <td>PRE_SELECT, POST_SELECT</td>
            <td>based on crawledAt field, a resource is selected to be crawled</td>            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">FETCH</th>
            <td>PRE_FETCH, POST_FETCH</td>
            <td>based on the defined request headers, the resource content is retrieved</td>            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">PROCESS</th>
            <td>PRE_PROCESS, POST_PROCESS</td>
            <td>based on content-type, extension, etc., the resource content is scrapped</td>            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">SAVE</th>
            <td>PRE_SAVE, POST_SAVE</td>
            <td>resource is updated, newly found resources are inserted for future crawling</td>            
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h5 class="subtitle">BasePlugin</h5>
Each plugin extends BasePlugin.</br></br>

Each phase can have one or multiple plugins attached to it.</br>
A plugin instance declares the phase it belongs to via pluginInstance.getPhase().</br></br>

During each phase, all corresponding plugins are tested for execution via pluginInstance.test(resource). </br>
Depending on the resource some plugins may return false and have their execution skipped.</br>
For example, JsDomPlugin can create a jsdom instance from html content but not from binary content.</br></br>

A plugin is invoked via pluginInstance.apply(site, resource).<br/>
Its return contentent is merged with the current resource.<br/><br/>

The architecture is easily extensible.<br/>
Just add a new plugin to a site via site.use(pluginInstance). <br/>
If the site already contains an instance of the same plugin, the new instance will replace the old one.
