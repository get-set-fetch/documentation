Scrapping a site for images.
<br/><br/>

{% include guides/docco/image-scrapper.html %}

<br/>
Once imgCrawl complete, all site images have been saved to disk.<br/>
Pdf scrapping can be achieved in the same way, just modify the extensionRe option from ExtractUrlPlugin and PersistResourcePlugin with a 
regexp matching the resource type(s) you want to scrape.
