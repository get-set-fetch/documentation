<p>
  You start by creating a project with name, description, base url and scraping scenario. 
</p>
<p>
  After the project is created you can start scraping from the selected base url.
</p>
<p>
  Once scraping is complete you can view the results and export them. All scenarios support scraping javascript based, dynamically generated pages.
